 Gazebo-7-on-ROS-Indigo
 Install Gazebo 7 on ROS Indigo (which primarily and by default supports Gazebo 2)
 After installing ROS Indigo from http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu 
 we find that since ROS Indigo uses Gazebo 2 it is automatically installed when 
 we run $ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full .
 First remove Gazebo 2 using $ sudo apt-get remove gazebo2* 
 After that follow the script https://github.com/nubot-nudt/simatch/blob/master/gazebo7_install.sh 
 must be run.
